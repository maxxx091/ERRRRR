            <strong>Dear Sophia,</strong>
            <p>
              Happy Girlfriends Day Mahal, I know that we are not that official yet in a sense, but still, I want to greet you pa rin. I made this short poem nung isang gabi kasi gusto kong sabihin na sobrang mahal kita â€” but yeah, tinula ko na lang nun nung gabing iyon. Mwehehehee.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we have our bond each night, I canâ€™t help but feel light. As I fall in love and feel you in my core â€” I donâ€™t know â€” but I appreciate you more. The unceasing thoughts of you in my mind conclude that no other soul Iâ€™ll ever find.
            </p>
            <p>
              The words I canâ€™t help but say are words I can use every day. And as you sleep well and tight, Iâ€™ll say this phrase because I know Iâ€™m right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Oh my dear Sophia, I love you so so much. ðŸ˜”
